# Challenges to Consider

## Battery Usage

- **Challenge**: Continuous location tracking can drain battery.
- **Solution**: Implement variable update frequencies (1-5 minutes).

## Data Usage

- **Challenge**: Real-time location updates can use significant data.
- **Solution**: Optimize update frequency and payload size.

## Privacy

- **Challenge**: Need clear controls for location sharing.
- **Solution**:
  - Option to temporarily disable tracking.
  - Group leave functionality.

## Offline Handling

- **Challenge**: Need to handle network disconnections.
- **Solution**: Cache last known locations.

# Is it a Good Product?

**YES**, because:

- Solves a real problem for a specific use case.
- Has clear target users (bike groups).
- Can expand to other use cases (family, pets, elderly).
- Technically feasible with reasonable costs.
- Not too complex to build an MVP.

# Recommended Development Phases

## Phase 1 (MVP)

- Basic group creation.
- Real-time location sharing.
- Simple map view.
- Basic markers.

## Phase 2

- Custom photo markers.
- Direction routing.
- Start/end location setting.
- Path drawing.

## Phase 3

- Offline support.
- Battery optimization.
- Distance calculations.
- ETA features.

## Phase 4

- Chat integration.
- Route history.
- Analytics.
- Emergency alerts.

# Would you like me to provide specific code examples for any of these components?

For instance, I could show you how to:

- Set up real-time location updates.
- Implement custom markers with photos.
- Handle route drawing.
- Set up the backend architecture.
